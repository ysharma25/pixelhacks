  <h class="header">Allergies</h>

  <h1>Peanut</h1>
  <p>A peanut allergy is very common and could cause a serious and possibly fatal reaction. If a guest has a peanut allergy you should avoid any kind of nut, even artificial. Also be mindful of dishes that may be cooked in peanut oil.</p>
  <h1>Milk</h1>
  <p>A milk allergy is different than lactose intolerance and is most common in infants and young children, although most will outgrow the allergy. Cow milk and products should be avoided, as reactions can be mild, such as hives, and sometimes life threatening. It is also wise to avoid milk from all other animals.</p>
  <h1>Egg</h1>
  <p>Egg allergies are the second most common childhood allergy and most children will outgrow it. Reactions can be mild, such as hives, and sometimes life threatening. Eggs from other birds should also be avoided.</p>
  <h1>Wheat</h1>
  <p>Not to be confused with gluten intolerance, wheat allergies can be mild or life threatening. Many people with wheat allergies can tolerate other grains, but it's safe to stay away from them if you don't know for sure.</p>
  <h1>Soy</h1>
  <p>Soy is another common infant and childhood allergy that is often outgrown. Soy allergies can be mild or severe, though severe reactions are rare.</p>
  <h1>Fish</h1>
  <p>People with fish allergies are most commonly allergic to salmon, tuna and halibut, although it is advised to avoid all fish. Many people who are allergic to finned fish are not allergic to shellfish. Be advised that fish protein can become airborne in the steam released while cooking.</p>
  <h1>Shellfish</h1>
  <p>Shrimp, crab and lobster cause most shellfish allergies and 60% of people with this allergy experienced their first reaction as an adult. There are two kinds of shellfish: crustacean (shrimp, crab and lobster) and mollusks (clams, mussels, oysters and scallops). Most shellfish reactions tend to be severe. It is also best to avoid all shellfish if there is an allergic reaction to any of them.</p>

  <!-- Religious restriction checkboxes -->
  <h class="header">Religious Restrictions</h>

  <h1>Christian</h1>
  <p>For most Christians, eating habits are not affected- though some will be vegetarians, usually for moral reason, and some will refrain from eating meat on Fridays. Some sects, for instance Mormons, have many rules and restrictions regarding eating and drinking, for sample complete abstinence from tea, coffee and alcohol and an emphasis on wholesome eating.</p>
  <h1>Judaism/Kosher</h1>
  <p>Jewish dietary laws are known as Kashrut, and are among the most complex of all religious food practices. The term Kosher means fit and describes all foods that are permitted for consumption. A Kosher kitchen is divided into separate sections one for dairy, meat and pareve. Different sets of utensils, pots, pans, plates, knives, chopping boards are used in each section of a Kosher kitchen. If your kitchen is not normally used for kosher food, it would be well advised to source a local Kosher caterer to provide a certified kosher meal for the guest. They would provide Kosher utensils, cups, plates for the occasion. The meal can easily be re heated in an oven or microwave but must be keep covered so the guest can see the rabbinic certifications seal is intact. </p>
  <h1>Muslim</h1>
  <p>This religion has various food restrictions according to their own dietary laws, which are Halaal. During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims are not allowed to eat from dawn to sunset. However young  children, pregnant women and the sick are often exempted. As similar to other religions, it would be advisable to enquire as to what restrictions the guest has.</p>
  <h1>Hindu</h1>
  <p>Most Hindus do not eat meat ( strict Hindus are vegetarians) and none eat beef since the cow is sacred to them. </p>
  <h1>Buddhist</h1>
  <p>Strict Buddhists are vegetarians and their dishes vary since many live in India and China, where available foods will be different. </p>

  <!-- Health condition checkboxes -->
  <h class="header">Health Conditions</h>

  <h1>Diabetes</h1>
  <p>There are several types of diabetes. The most common are type 1 and type 2. In type 1, the pancreas makes little or no insulin. Individuals with type 1 need insulin shots in order to stay alive. Type 1 can occur at any age, but is usually seen in children and young adults. With type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces some insulin. type 2 diabetes need insulin to regulate their blood glucose, while others respond well to diet therapy and exercise alone, or a combination of diet, exercise and oral medication. Starches (pastas, rice, bread, cake, potatoes, corn, etc.), fruit and milk are high in carbohydrates. Once in your body, they break down into your cells' preferred form of energy-glucose. Insulin is needed to help your cells take in the glucose. With diabetes, your insulin cannot do this task properly. A diabetic diet helps you schedule your carbohydrate intake so that your cells can get the glucose that they need.</p>
  <h1>Gluten Free</h1>
  <p>Gluten is a protein found in all forms of wheat (including durum, semolina, and spelt), rye, oats, barley. When people with celiac disease consume gluten, the absorptive villi in the small intestine are damaged, preventing the absorption of many important nutrients. The long-term effect of untreated celiac disease can be life threatening. However, with a completely gluten-free diet, the intestinal lining will heal completely allowing most patients to live a normal, healthy life as long as they remain free of gluten in their diet. Even a small amount of gluten can cause symptoms to reoccur.</p>
  <h1>Lactose Intolerant</h1>
  <p>Lactose intolerance is the inability to properly digest milk sugar, also known as lactose. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include abdominal bloating, gaseousness, flatulence, cramping, and diarrhea following the consumption of food containing dairy products or by-products. Milk protein allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins commonly found in cows milk. It is caused by your immune system reacting because it believes the protein in the milk is a threat to your body. Your immune system will do it's best to get rid of the invader, just as it would a foreign virus or poison. During the allergic reaction your body releases histamine, a chemical which causes blood vessels to dilate and leak, mucous membranes to start producing skin rashes, vomiting and other effects.</p>
